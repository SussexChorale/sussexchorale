## Welcome

Sussex Chorale was founded in 2022, following the disruption that covid brought to most choral singing. Under the baton of Stephen Hope, together with our resident accompanist David Moore, we sing a wide variety of mainly sacred music and welcome new singers in all voice parts.

In the summer term, Sussex Chorale joins with the Sussex Festival Choir to sing a major work at Arundel Cathedral.
